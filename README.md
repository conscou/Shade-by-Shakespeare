# Shade-by-Shakespeare
Everyone knows that Shakespeare was the shadiest writer in the English language. 

This Pebble app--written in JavaScript--provides the user with either an insult from the Bard's own works, or a completely randomized insult that would most likely receive the Bard's stamp of approval (the latter based on the Shakespeare Insult Kit).
